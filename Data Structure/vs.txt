The world faces two major challenges: climate change and gender inequality. These two might seem like different issues, but they are actually closely connected. Climate change does not affect everyone equally.  Women and girls, especially in vulnerable regions like Africa and Asia, bear the brunt of climate change, worsening existing inequalities and threatening their livelihoods. A report from UN Women at COP28 predicts that by 2050, climate change could push up to 158 million more women into poverty and leave 232 million facing food insecurity. According to NASA and the United Nations, women are also underrepresented in climate decision-making. Extreme weather—storms, floods, and heatwaves—forces thousands to leave their homes worldwide.

Meet Halima, a woman from Chakaria, a rural village in Cox’s Bazar district of southeastern Bangladesh, who once had a small vegetable garden, along with a few ducks and chickens. But now, those are gone. Every year, she faces the devastating impact of climate change. Heatwaves dry out her land, floods destroy whatever little she manages to grow, and the increasing salinity of the soil from rising sea levels makes farming even more difficult. For women like Halima, climate change isn’t just an environmental issue; it’s a barrier to survival and economic independence.
Halima’s story represents millions of women worldwide who are disproportionately affected by climate change. They face greater risks of heat-related illnesses, lost livelihoods, and limited opportunities for self-reliance.
But what if women like Halima could turn these challenges into opportunities? What if they had the tools, resources, and support to lead efforts in building climate resilience? That’s where we come in.
Rokeya:
We are Checkmate Beta, a diverse team of both men and women participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. Together, we are addressing the intertwined challenges of climate change and gender inequality by empowering women to lead through innovative, data-driven solutions. We believe that where there’s a challenge, there’s also opportunity.
Shafin:
We can harness the power of data to create inclusive solutions. That’s why we created the Empowering Women for Climate Action and Gender Equality project. Our initiative addresses these challenges with both short-term and long-term solutions aimed at empowering women like Halima to be leaders in climate resilience.
Our long-term solution is the Green Empowerment Platform—an interactive website that enables women to create sustainable rooftop farms and balcony gardens. This platform provides step-by-step guidance on climate-resilient plants, mentorship for women facing challenges, and a community forum for sharing experiences, challenges, and solutions—building a supportive network. Users can contribute to tree-planting efforts and access eco-friendly tools through a dedicated marketplace. Leveraging NASA’s Environmental Justice data and insights from the UN Ozone Secretariat and ESA SDGs, our platform educates users on how climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable communities, particularly women, and empowers them to lead sustainable change. Using NASA Earth data and geospatial technology, users can visualize their local environment, assess green cover, and determine how many trees are needed to restore ecosystems for a healthier habitat.
Rokeya:
To address immediate challenges, we’ve developed the Automatic Cooling Spray System—solar-powered towers that activate during extreme heat, spraying a fine mist to cool public spaces. This system helps reduce heat-related health risks and keeps women safe and productive, even during heatwaves. Using NASA’s climate and temperature datasets to anticipate heatwave patterns, cooling systems can be deployed in high-risk public spaces to mitigate the health impacts on vulnerable populations, particularly women.
Shafin:
We believe Together, these solutions can be game-changers. The Automatic Cooling Spray System cools public spaces, while the Green Empowerment Platform fosters greener communities by maximizing limited land for rooftop farming and providing alternatives when tree planting isn't feasible.
By leveraging NASA's data and resources, both approaches empower women to shape their economic futures and lead climate resilience efforts through enhanced urban farming, supporting climate action and gender equality.
But this is just the beginning. With support from NASA, including data from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) and NASA Earth-data, we aim to expand our project globally. By enhancing environmental justice, reducing poverty, and promoting climate action, we contribute to multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals—particularly SDG 5: Gender Equality and SDG 13: Climate Action.

Join us in planting the seeds of change—together, we can turn challenges into opportunities and make a sustainable future, where gender equality and climate action work hand-in-hand to build a better world for everyone.
Thank You
